Zentoo Linux
============

Zentoo Linux is variant of Gentoo Linux with an emphasis on server deployment
on x86/amd64 platforms.

Zentoo Linux -- just like Gentoo Linux -- is a source based Linux distribution
with a live package tree. Zentoo Linux offers multiple branches in its package
repository which roughly correspond to what other distributions call releases.

In contrast to Gentoo Linux, Zentoos branches are maintained with an emphasis
on stable server deployments and therefore upgrades in the same branch are
generally seamless and without breakage.
